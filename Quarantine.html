    <h4>Place and Period</h4>
    <span style="font-family:times;">I stayed at an <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/?locale=en&_set_bev_on_new_domain=1625583549_YzFlNzM1NGM1NzBl" target="_blank">airbnb</a> provided by my host family for 15 days. It was a beautiful house with pink exterior and modern interior. There were two bedrooms, however, since I was alone to quarantine, I used only one of them. It was equipped with a TV in the living room, and all kinds of appliances in the kitchen including a microwave, oven, dishwasher, and so forth. As I stayed on the ground floor unit, I had access to a cute backyard, which would be covered with a lot of snow at that time.</span>
