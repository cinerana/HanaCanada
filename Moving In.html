    <h4>How I Met My Family</h4>
    <span style="font-family:times;">
    <p>
    To find a host family for my Au Pair experience, I used the <a href="https://www.aupairworld.com/en" target="_blank">AuPairWorld</a> website. Of course it was one of the many websites I used to get a job offer, including <a href="https://ca.indeed.com/" target="_blank">Indeed</a>, <a href="https://www.kijiji.ca/" target="_blank">Kijiji</a>, etc., because it was (and I think it still is) impossible for an IEC participant to enter Canada without a valid job offer. Luckily, I found the family I'm living with now and after a couple of Zoom interviews, we decided to sign the contract and proceed.

    <h4><span style="font-family:malgungothic;">First Day with the Family</span></h4>
    <p>
    <span style="font-family:times;">The day I moved in, it didn't snow. So it was much easier for me to carry my luggage, which included one huge suitcase, a 70L hiking backpack, and a carry on suitcase. I unpacked my bags, organized a bit, and not long after we had dinner. Host parents asked me if I wanted to eat anything specific and not knowing much about what's in the neighborhood, I just said something Canadian. They ordered burgers, poutines, and even pizza if I remember correctly, and they were all good. They showed me around the house, during which the toddler copied them, pointing at random stuff and trying to say something. They also intorduced me to their animals, a dog and two cats, and the boy cat was so friendly that he wanted to cuddle with me right away. Although I was quite nervous because it was the first time for me to actually meet the whole family in person, everything went so well and I felt very welcome.
